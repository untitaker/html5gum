this is a tag: <h1>test</h1>

tags can have attributes: <div id = foobar>

Attribute values can be quoted: <input name = 'age' type = "number">

But you cannot put attributes everywhere: </nope data=foobar>

Please mind the gap: < test

The pirate says &arrrrr;

Does this open two pages? <a href=foo.html href=bar.html>click me</a>

Do you start or do you end? </yes/>
